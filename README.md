# PLANISUSS
Planisuss was an exam project done by me and another student of AI, it simulates an environment in which there are 3 species: the vegetals, the erbivors and the carnivors. The main objective was to create a balanced environment that could self sostain and keep on running for a long amount of time.
When looking at the grid:
- The blue cells represent the water, cells over which individuals cannot be on
- The cells that go from white to green are the ground cells, which represent the amount of grass present in the cell (the greener the cell, the more grass)
- The black cells represent groups of erbivors, that move around to find grass to eat and to run away from the carnivors
- The red cells represent the groups of carnivors, that are less but more dynamic then the erbivors, and their aim is to hunt them
